# WeatherApp

I build this project in order to practice APIs data fetching, with JavaScript, for "The Odin Project" syllabus.
In the road I noticed that I still have to work and learn way more about responsive front-end development, and optimize and clean some functions in the program.

The UI is strongly based on this [weather website](https://dribbble.com/shots/14628486-Forecast-Weather-Website-Design) design by Guhan Bask.
The [icons](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1126777451931792118) I used were created by Bill Arve, I really think it is the best free design of this style on the internet.
